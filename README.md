# Game Quality Engineering Showcase

A collection of projects and scripts demonstrating my automation skills in game testing.

## Skills & Technologies
- **Programming:** Airtest, Python, Allure
- **Game Engines:** Unity, Unreal Engine
- **CI/CD:** Jenkins, Jmeter
- **Performance Testing:** PerfDog
- **Test Management:** Jira, Teambition

## Projects

### [Project 1: Mini Automated Testing Framework for Games]
- **Description:** A lightweight automation framework built with Python and Airtest for testing games. It supports cross-platform execution (Android/iOS/PC) and generates detailed Allure reports.
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Airtest, Allure
- **Status:** In Progress
- **Goals:**
  - [ ] Implement basic test case structure
  - [ ] Integrate with Appium for device control
  - [ ] Add Allure reporting
  - [ ] Create a sample test for a game

### [Project 2: Performance Benchmarking Tool]
- **Description:** A script to automate the collection and analysis of game performance metrics (FPS, Memory, CPU) using PerfDog's API.
- **Status:** Planned

## Learning Journey
I'm currently on a 6-month plan to transition from QA to QE. This repository documents my progress and projects.

- **Current Focus:** Deepening Python and Airtest skills, building a robust automation framework.
