# Game Quality Engineering Showcase

A collection of projects and scripts demonstrating my automation skills in game testing.

## Skills & Technologies
- **Programming:** Airtest, Python, Allure
- **Game Engines:** Unity, Unreal Engine
- **CI/CD:** Jenkins, Jmeter
- **Performance Testing:** PerfDog
- **Test Management:** Jira

## Projects

### [Project 1: Mini Automated Testing Framework for Mobile Games]
- **Description:** A lightweight automation framework built with Python and Pytest for testing mobile games. It supports cross-platform execution (Android/iOS) and generates detailed Allure reports.
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Pytest, Allure, Appium
- **Status:** In Progress
- **Goals:**
  - [ ] Implement basic test case structure
  - [ ] Integrate with Appium for device control
  - [ ] Add Allure reporting
  - [ ] Create a sample test for a demo game

### [Project 2: Performance Benchmarking Tool]
- **Description:** A script to automate the collection and analysis of game performance metrics (FPS, Memory, CPU) using PerfDog's API.
- **Status:** Planned

## Learning Journey
I'm currently on a 6-month plan to transition from QA to QE. This repository documents my progress and projects.

- **Current Focus:** Deepening Python and Pytest skills, building a robust automation framework.
